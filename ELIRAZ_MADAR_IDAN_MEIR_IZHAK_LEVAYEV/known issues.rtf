# Known Issues

In this project, there are several runtime issues that we have addressed through proactive measures such as implementing `try-catch` blocks to prevent crashes and handling errors at the function level without impacting the entire system. Below are the details of the known issues:

1. **File Not Found Errors**:
   - Issue: Attempting to read from a file that does not exist by performing a `restore` operation from the main menu.
   - Mitigation: The system checks file existence before attempting to read, and errors are logged with user-friendly messages.

2. **Redo/Undo Operation Limitations**:
   - Issue: Performing `redo` or `undo` actions when the operation stack is empty.
   - Mitigation: The application validates the state of the stack before executing these operations and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Issue: Input errors at specific points in the program may lead to unhandled exceptions.
   - Mitigation: A dedicated input validation class ensures the correctness of user inputs, significantly reducing the occurrence of such issues. While we have not encountered runtime errors during testing, edge cases may still exist.

We are continually improving the system to address these and other potential issues. Please report any additional bugs or concerns to the project repository.
